    <h1>Clean Code Guidelines</h1>

    <h2>Names</h2>
    <p>
        Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and other entities. Follow the naming
        conventions specified by the professor (e.g., camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase). Avoid ambiguous or misleading
        names.
    </p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>
        Keep methods/functions short and focused on a single responsibility (Single Responsibility Principle). Use
        meaningful method names that convey their purpose. Avoid long parameter lists; consider using objects to group
        related parameters.
    </p>

    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <p>
        Write comments only when necessary and focus on explaining the "why" rather than the "what" (code should be
        self-explanatory). Follow the professor's guidelines on commenting style. Regularly review and update comments
        to ensure they stay accurate.
    </p>

    <h2>Formatting</h2>
    <p>
        Consistently apply indentation, spacing, and line breaks according to the professor's style guide. Maintain a
        consistent code style throughout the project. Consider using automated tools or linters to enforce formatting
        rules.
    </p>

    <h2>Objects and Data Structures</h2>
    <p>
        Design objects and data structures to be simple and easily understandable. Encapsulate behavior within objects
        and avoid exposing internal details. Follow principles like encapsulation and information hiding.
    </p>

    <h2>Error Handling</h2>
    <p>
        Handle errors consistently and gracefully. Use meaningful error messages that aid in debugging. Avoid suppressing
        or ignoring errors without appropriate justification.
